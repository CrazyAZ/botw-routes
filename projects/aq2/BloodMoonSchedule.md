# AQ2.1 Blood Moon Schedule (From 8:18 PB)

## How BM works
As soon as time of day is activated, the BM timer starts. If the BM timer is more than 7 in-game days (7d) as you cross midnight, the next night (21h from the midnight you crossed) is BM night.

## Safe Part
You should be able to do most of these without getting BM when sitting at campfire

If Start Time is `---`, that means same as previous End Time

## After Schedule Part
If you don't have a BM as you warp away from Eventide, you are safe to finish the rest on schedule.

However, after this part, if you need to set TOD because of rng rain in hateno, etc, you need to warp away to do BM first
