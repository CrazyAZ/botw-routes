### Other
For other blights you will use duplex bow instead of GEB to stasis+ kill

Ideally you don't reload until Korok Forest, where you use PE to desync bows and use shock trap to dupe
multishot bows during oaki for transmutation later (Swing great thunderblade and drop it and another metal weapon, desync, hold
bow out, step onto the shock trap to shock it out of your hand, it will create a new bow aka "true dupe")

If you have to lose PE, you can use overload desync + shock trap in Korok Forest. Alternatively, pick up bows throughout the run and dupe just before transmutation

Since you don't have enough hearts for MS, you would pull it at the end of the run and do the ice rod and blupee quest then.

The koroks in hestu 2 branch can be incorporated in letter quest branch:
- N01 > Z38 > Z39 > Z40 > Hinox/Z41
- Letter Quest > Moor Garrison > Sheh Rata
- C13 > Z12 > K35

Castle can be rerouted with
- X10 > X07 > Memory > DBG > X03 > (same) > X04
- Skip Memory and enter interior from the same place as start of the run
- Go to guards' chamber
- First Gatehouse > X18 > X22, 24 > X23 > X14 > X17 > X16 > Second GateHouse > X12 > Dining Hall
